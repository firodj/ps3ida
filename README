PS3IDA
======

** ps3ida -- A Collection of scripts and plugins for IDA and tools. **

If you need a README file to understand what this is, then this project
isn't meant for you...

Plugins included :
------------------

PPCAltivec : This plugin enables recognition of many extra processor
             specific instructions when using IDA Pro's PowerPC processor
             module.
             The added instructions support Altivec, VMX128,
             Xbox360(Xenon), PS3(CellBE) and GC/WII(Gekko).

PPCJT : This plugin adds Jump Table support to the PowerPC process module
        of IDA, resolving switch/cases into properly analyzed code.


Tools included :
-----------------

find_fnids.sh : A script that will look for Function IDs (FNID) from .a
                files (path to $(SDK)/target/ppu/lib directory as first
                argument to the script) and generate an FNIDS file

 -- The FNIDS file format is "module  0xFNID  functionName comments" --

ps3.xml : This file comes from xorloser's "SELF/SPRX Loader" and contains
          an FNID to FunctionName association table

ps3.tcl : This script transforms the ps3.xml file into a FNIDS file format
xml.tcl : include file needed by ps3.tcl

fnids_to_idh.tcl : A script that transforms a FNIDS file into fnids.idh
                   idc header file
fnids_to_idh2.tcl : A script that transforms a FNIDS file into fnids.idh
                    idc header file but ignores the name of the module.
                    (some fnids appear in multiple modules)

syscall_names.idh : Header file containing syscall and hypercall names
fnids.idh : Header file containing fnid to function associations
common.idh : Header file containing common functions

analyze_self.idc : IDC to analyze a decrypted .self file. It will find its
                   TOC (you need to set it manually yourself), defines the
                   OPD section and finds and defines the imported and the
                   exported symbols from the file

analyze_sprx.idc : IDC to analyze a decrypted .sprx file. It will find its
                   TOC (you need to set it manually yourself), defines the
                   OPD section and finds and defines the imported and the
                   exported symbols from the file

find_stdu.idc : Simple and stupid script that finds all 'stdu' instructions
                and creates a function there

lv2_dump_analyser.idc : IDC script that analyzes a raw dump of LV2
lv2_dump_analyser_60.idc : IDC script that analyzes a raw dump of LV2
                           ported to work properly on IDA 6.0

find_lv1_call.idc : Simple IDC that asks for a hypercall number and finds
                    all the calls to that hypercall in a lv2 dump

PS3_HV_Dump.idc : Original HV dump analyzer IDC script by xorloser
